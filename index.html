          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          
          <p> As a whole, Connecticut has been dealing with a crash problem for a number of years now. While the entire state of Connecticut is suffering, we want to dive deep into the Hartford data. To keep Hartford as safe as possible we want to gather data that will lead us to understand how and when crashes happen in Hartford specifically. We are focusing on Hartford because we are working with our Hartford Community partners to better understand the city. Hartford is also a place where we as Trinity College students will be spending many years of our lives so we want to keep it as safe as possible. We are using the Uconn crash data from 2018-2022 to help us answer the following questions. “What types of injuries are sustained in Hartford Crashes & how has this data changed from 2018-2022” And, "How Has Weather Affected Hartford Crashes & How Has This Changed Over the Years?” Once we answer these questions and look at the data in our charts we will be able to see and understand the most common types of crashes and the severity of them as well as how weather has affected Hartford since 2018. Our hope for all of this is to limit the crashes happening in Hartford by outlining the most common type of crashes. The first pattern/correlation that we would like to examine is, the severity of crashes occurring in Hartford?
   
            </p>
          
          <p> In 2022, alone, there were 5,289 crashes that occurred in Hartford, Connecticut (UCONN Crash Data Repository). Although it is easy to know that this is a very high number, We wanted to investigate the turnouts of these crashes by injuries. Which types of  injuries are happening the most often? How many of these injuries are happening? And has this changed over time? All questions that we aimed to answer by specifically highlighting minor, serious, and fatal injuries over the last five years (2018-2022).</p>
          
          <p>(Crash Severity Chart)</p>

          <iframe title="[ Comparison of Injuries Sustained from Hartford Crashes (2018-2022) ]" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-WRugu" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WRugu/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="479" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
         
          
          <p>Being that Hartford lies in the Northeast, in New England specifically, the weather and seasons are changing very frequently. In agreement with common belief, these changes in weather are responsible for many crashes that otherwise may not have occurred. By using the Hartford crash data, we want to be able to see how weather has affected Hartford crashes over the years. In our chart, we used the years 2018-2022, and the weather conditions “rain”, “snow”, “clear”, and “cloudy” in order to draw conclusions about this. To our surprise we found that “clear” weather conditions existed the most during Hartford crashes, with around 80% or more of crashes occurring during clear conditions each year. In a far second, “Rain”, third, “Cloudy", and fourth “Snow”. As a whole, we saw an overall downwards trend in crashes during every condition since 2018.</p>

          <h2>Obtaining Data</h2>
          <p>We made this chart by creating a pivot table of the UCONN Hartford crash data 2018-2022 that we were given. We did this by making “Year” the rows, and “crash severity” the values. We then changed the color of the bar to make comparison easier to comprehend.</p>
          
          <p>Explanation: As we can see in the bar graph above, there has been a steady decline in crashes as a whole since 2018. Crashes went from almost 2,000 a year to well under 1,500 which is amazing. As we can see minor injuries seem to be the most prevelent injuries sustained from hartford crashes. There is a large drop off from this to serious and fatal injuries which both sit at under 100 every year.</p>

          <h2>Credit Where Credit is Due</h2>
          <p>Give credit to people, organizations, resources, and tools that helped you to create this data story. Write in HTML format and include links when appropriate. When you paraphrase or quote from a specific reading, cite it using any standard academic citation style (such as MLA or APA inline citations), and include the full reference in a bibliography section at the end of your data story. For help with creating citations, I highly recommend the <a href='https://zbib.org'>Zbib.org</a> tool. Insert any URL, but you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details, such as author and date if the tool does not automatically recognize them, as shown in Image 1 and 2 below.</p>

          <img src="sample-zbib1.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 1: After inserting a URL into the ZBib.org tool, you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details.</i></p>

          <img src="sample-zbib2.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 2: Clicking the Edit button in ZBib allows you to enter or correct missing details, such as the full Website Title.</i></p>

          <p>Below are sample sentences with MLA inline citations that would appear in the body of the data story, followed by the full references that would appear in the bibliography at the bottom:</p>

          <h4>Sample sentences</h4>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Resident Town Export”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <h4>Works Cited:</h4>

          <p>Lurye, Rebecca. “New Housing Code in Hartford Would Keep Slumlords from Hiding Behind LLCs.” Hartford Courant, May 31, 2019. <a href='https://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-news-hartford-housing-code-20190531-hcke2jo2x5fpdgz75xf4hlv2ki-story.html'>https://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-news-hartford-housing-code-20190531-hcke2jo2x5fpdgz75xf4hlv2ki-story.html</a>.</p>

          <p>Optional Hint: To display a clickable web link in the bibliography, look at the HTML code in GitHub for the examples above. See how the URL appears twice: once in the "href" and again in the display text. This is not required for your data story, but it looks good and helps readers to click and view your sources.</p>

          <p>We wanted to add more information about Connecticut crashes and pedestrian saftey. While many crashes happen in Connecticut every year, we often fail to remember that pedestrians and cyclists are also heavily effected. With lack of protection and reaction time, pedestrians and cyclists are often more severly injured compared to moterists. Below is a link to CT Insider as well as other surrounding Hartford sources.  </p>
          
         <p> CT INSIDER - (https://www.ctinsider.com/news/article/West-Hartford-pedestrian-safety-17478465.php) </p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
